When chaining complex workflows (building particles, combining them, etc) we find that our ntuple is not written while we don't have any errors.
The first step is to look at the logs.
Let's first go back at what we learned [when building our own decays](https://lhcb.github.io/second-analysis-steps/01-building-decays.html) and rerun again (saving the output to a log file!).

We can scroll through the log until we find our selections, where we will see something like this:

Here we have information of the input containers, types of particles, etc, with all the counters corresponding to our run on 1000 events.

> ## Understanding the log {.challenge}
> How many $D^*$ do we expect in our ntuple? Can you check it?
> Can you change some cuts and see how he counters change? Try to free the $D^*$ mass and see if we get more of those.

Now, let's make the particle builder fail silently and see if we can debug this.
For example, imagine we forgot to add the Kaons as inputs in `Sel_D0`:

```python
d0_sel = Selection('Sel_D0',
                   Algorithm=d0,
                   RequiredSelections=[Pions])
```

Then we get

```

```

It's easy to see we have 0 input kaons and we can see we only get input pions!

Another problem: we messed up with a cut, for example in building the $D^*$,

```python
dstar_mother = (
    "(abs(M-MAXTREE('D0'==ABSID,M)-145.42) < 10*MeV)"
    '& (VFASPF(VCHI2/VDOF) < 0)'
)
```

Running this, we get

```

```

And we would get suspicious about the `MotherCut`...

The final trick is to use the `StoreExplorerAlg`, which shows us the state of the TES in the middle of execution.
We can configure it very easily and insert it in the DaVinci sequence to see what is happening.

```python
from Configurables import StoreExplorerAlg

DaVinci().UserAlgorithms += [StoreExplorerAlg("Before"),
                             dstar_seq.sequence(),
                             StoreExplorerAlg("After")]
```

And then run it:

Here we can see where our decays are being put and we can debug problems with inputs and outputs.
It can also be useful to know where things are written for accessing them interactively, if we want to further explore and debug.

> ## Configuring the algorithm {.callout}
>
> The `StoreExplorerAlg` has the same print frequency as `DaVinci`, but it can be configured by modifying `PrintFreq` (fraction of events that are printed) or `PrintEvt`.
> Have a look at the [class Doxygen](http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/moore/releases/v14r2p5/doxygen/d2/d3b/class_store_explorer_alg.html) to see what they do.
